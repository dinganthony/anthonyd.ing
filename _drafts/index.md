Hi! I'm Anthony Ding, a software engineer and student majoring in [EECS @ UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu). I love writing, whether it be [code](projects), [stories](https://nanowrimo.org/participants/anthonyding), [blog posts](https://anthony.imprint.to), or [sports analyses](tactical-press).

Previously, I interned @ [Amazon](https://amazon.com) and [UBTECH Robotics](https://ubtrobot.com/), and conducted research @ [Berkeley Lab](https://lbl.gov) under Professor Haichen Wang, developing [graph neural networks](https://github.com/xju/root_gnn) to classify subatomic particle interactions. 

Let's [get in touch](contact)!
