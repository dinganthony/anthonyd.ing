Teaching and mentoring are incredibly rewarding experiences. I'm super fortunate to have had these opportunities to help students in the Berkeley electrical engineering and computer science community. Being a part of course staff and teaching organizations have been highlights of my undergraduate experience.

As instruction has gone virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I thought it would be helpful to compile links to worksheets I've created, courses I've helped teach, and other resources I like.

## CS Mentors

[CSM](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu) is Berkeley's largest student organization devoted to teaching and mentoring, with over 1500 students and 300 mentors each semester.

##### Content Mentor (Fall 2020)

As a content mentor, I created worksheets in LaTeX that were used in section by other mentors for EECS 16A: Designing Information Devices and Systems. 16A, the first of Berkeley's two lower-division EECS classes, introduces topics like linear algebra, circuits, and machine learning fundamentals. You can find this semester's worksheets and solutions [here](https://eecs16a.org/#csm).

##### Junior Mentor (Spring 2020)

* 3Blue1Brown's "Essence of Linear Algebra" [videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
* 16A [Course Website](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~eecs16a/sp20/)
* Zoom Link *(closed)*
