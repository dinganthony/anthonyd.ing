title: My Favorite Pokémon
---

I'm unashamedly a huge fan of the Pokémon video game series. Some of my fondest memories with elementary school friends involved telling our Turtwig to Tackle its opponents repeatedly, spamming the attack on our silver Nintendo DS Lite. Not to mention getting absolutely destroyed by the Gym Leaders due to not understanding all the type matchups. And vibing at nighttime to the jazzy counter-melody of Jubilife City's background music, inspired by the city of Sapporo, Japan. Ah, Pokémon Diamond, good times!

Honestly, I have no idea what keeps drawing me back every generation: is it the aforementioned nostalgia, or the soundtracks, or the graphics? Or simply that chill, turn-based games which have reduced difficulty levels to cater to players increasingly younger than me are a welcome escape from the stresses of studying EECS at Cal? Whatever the reason, I've played through most of the mainline games since Gen 4, watched half(?) of the anime, and dabbled in competitive (mostly VGC, but some singles as well). I wouldn't say I'm a true Pokémon fanatic though, since I couldn't tell you much about Generations 1 and 2 or rare Charizard trading cards. At best, I'm a casual enthusiast for the franchise.

As is common with casual fans, I've subconsciously liked or disliked certain Pokémon throughout my playthroughs. With almost 900 'mons and counting, everyone's bound to pick favorites. For instance -- and these are probably hot takes, since they're generally very popular Pokémon -- I can't stand Sylveon, Incineroar, or any of the starter Pokémon in Sword and Shield. And don't get me started on the entire Best Wishes anime series. 

But enough with the negativity: I'd like to share a full team of my six favorite Pokémon. Remarkably, this team synergizes quite well! They cover for each other's type weaknesses, as every type is adequately resisted except Ghost and Fighting. I also gave them moves with good coverage: given any existing type combination (besides Ghost/Dark), at least one member can deal super effective damage. And there's a good mix of physical and special attackers, which is pretty sweet for in game playthroughs (who am I kidding, the best strat is to overlevel your starter and sweep everything anyway).

This wasn't intentional, but the team consists of a starter, eeveelution, fossil, legendary, and Mega! Adding in Flygon, the evolved form of my first trading card 'mon, Vibrava. Anyways, I tried giving them competitive movesets for VGC, a double battle format. It's definitely not a functional competitive team, however, as Fennekin has a base stat total of only 307. Without further ado, here are my six favorite Pokémon!

<a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/fennekin" style="color: #F08030">Fennekin</a> @ Lum Berry<br>
Ability: Magician

- Flamethrower
- Psyshock
- Grass Knot
- Will-O-Wisp

When Fennekin was revealed as one of the three starter Pokémon for the Kalos Region, I was hyped, only to be let down when I saw Braixen and Delphox. But Fennekin is still my favorite starter due to its poise, fire and psychic moves, and cute moments in the anime. Although it's a fiery fox, it kind of reminds me of a puppy, being friendly, warm, and loyal, but also a bit of a trickster. Flamethrower and Psyshock are STAB, and Grass Knot provides nice coverage. Will-O-Wisp's burns are useful because the team has no strong physical bulk nor Intimidate users.

Fennekin's hidden ability, Magician, has a unique mechanic which steals the held items of any Pokémon it attacks, as long as Fennekin isn't holding an item. Lum Berry is preferred over an item like Eviolite, as Fennekin can absorb status moves for the team while being able to proc Magician. As you'll see in a bit, this team somewhat utilizes the Hail weather condition, so other single use items like Focus Sash or the Power Herb (intended to work with Solarbeam) set aren't really great. Magician is quite nice in doubles, as Fennekin can actually attack its partner to remove a tricked Choice item.

<a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/aurorus" style="color: #B8A038">Aurorus</a> @ Light Clay<br>
Ability: Snow Warning

- Aurora Veil
- Meteor Beam
- Blizzard
- Icy Wind

Shoutout to middle school me for picking the Sail Fossil over the Jaw Fossil in Pokémon X. Aurorus is so majestic, being a revived fossil from prehistoric times. The Tundra Pokémon has an incredible design resembling a sauropod, with a smooth yellow to silver gradient on its sail and icy diamonds on its body. It also sports a unique type combination in Rock/Ice, and one of my favorite abilities in Snow Warning, which instantly sets the Hail weather condition on the battlefield.

Hail is really underappreciated but synergizes quite well with Aurora Veil, which effectively sets dual screens in one turn but can only be activated under the icy conditions, and Blizzard, which it causes to bypass the accuracy check! Meteor Beam is the strongest special Rock type move available, making Dynamaxing possible. Icy Wind is standard for speed control. Light Clay extends the duration of Aurora Veil, enabling Pokémon like Mega Lucario to thrive.

<a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/glaceon" style="color: #98D8D8">Glaceon</a> @ Icium Z<br>
Ability: Snow Cloak

- Blizzard
- Freeze-Dry
- Shadow Ball
- Fake Tears

The second member of the dynamic Hail duo and my favorite Eeveelution, Glaceon! In general, I'm fascinated by the creativity in the Eeveelutions, who are the eight evolved forms of Eevee. In the earlier games, Glaceon has an interesting evolution mechanic that involves leveling up near a specific icy rock in the northern, snow-covered routes of Sinnoh. This, along with its dog-like design and aesthetic regular and shiny sprites, makes the Fresh Snow Pokémon one of my favorites.

Glaceon's ability, Snow Cloak, raises its evasiveness in Hail, and it is best sent out in a double battle alongside Aurorus. In Hail, it can spam the powerful multi-target STAB Blizzard; outside of it, its whopping 130 base Special Attack ensures that Freeze-Dry hurts as well. Freeze-Dry also helps cover 'mons like Gyarados, Gastrodon, and other bulky waters. Glaceon's item, Icium Z, allows it to fire off powerful Subzero Slammers, as Ice is one of the best offensive types. Shadow Ball is probably the best coverage Glaceon gets, and the possible SpD drop is nice. Fake Tears helps soften up targets, further capitalizing on the team's skew towards special attackers.

<a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/flygon" style="color: #E0C068">Flygon</a> @ Choice Scarf<br>
Ability: Levitate

- Earth Power
- Dragon Claw
- Brutal Swing
- U-turn

Flygon carried me through Hoenn, period. In a world before Fairy types and Garchomp, Flygon's strong STAB Outrage and Earthquake swept much of the late game of Pokémon Emerald. Although I'd caught Rayquaza, which as one of the strongest legendaries does the same thing, I still kept Flygon in my Elite Four run. Flygon came in clutch again in Pokémon X, effectively sweeping five of Diantha's Pokémon. Also, can we talk about its design? The Mystic Pokémon, often nicknamed the Desert Spirit, is a levitating dragonfly-looking beast with red tinted goggles to protect its eyes in sandstorms.

Since Fairy types were introduced, Flygon has fallen off in competitive viability, but I chose to use a Choice Scarf set to take advantage of its stat distribution and strong movepool. Earth Power is preferred over Earthquake because the rest of the team is pretty weak to Ground, and that would be detrimental in Double Battles. For Dragon STAB, Dragon Claw over Outrage because, well, Fairies. Brutal Swing is an interesting coverage move and was selected for two reasons. First, I wanted a Dark type coverage move for the Normal/Psychic type combination. Second, it has amazing synergy with Lucario with its Justified ability. Even if its scarf is removed, Flygon still outspeeds Lucario by 10 points, allowing it to Brutal Swing first, hitting everything on the field including Lucario, and powering up its partner's Attack. U-turn to pivot and reset the Choice item. 

<a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/latias" style="color: #7038F8">Latias</a> @ Soul Dew<br>
Ability: Levitate

- Tailwind
- Draco Meteor
- Mist Ball
- Recover

Latias is, frankly, my favorite Pokémon of all time. A sensitive and highly intelligent Pokémon who can telepathically communicate with trainers? A Pokémon specced for a tanky and supportive role, finding creative ways to impact the team instead of ramming their head at the enemy with 130 base power moves? That happy smile and the aesthetic wing arrangement in her in game sprites? While all of those are qualities I admire, the favoritism started with my elementary school self imagining riding on one -- Latias can fly at multiple Mach numbers!

This moveset really draws to Latias's strengths, namely its 80/90/130 defensive stats. Tailwind enables Latias to support the entire team, especially in VGC. Both STABs, Draco Meteor and Mist Ball, are boosted by Soul Dew. By the way, I still believe that canonically the Soul Dew is in the original form, which increased Latias's Special Attack and Special Defense by 50%. But since the item got reworked in Alola, we'll just accept the boost to Psychic and Dragon moves. Recover is fantastic when combined with Latias's natural bulk and helps heal back the residual Hail damage from Aurorus's Snow Warning.

<a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/lucario" style="color: #C03028">Lucario-Mega</a> @ Lucarionite<br>
Ability: Justified

- Swords Dance
- Close Combat
- Meteor Mash
- Bullet Punch

Rounding out the list is Lucario, one of the OGs on my Sinnoh team and my favorite Mega Evolution from Kalos. After all, you're gifted a Riolu egg after completing the Iron Island storyline in Platinum, and Korrina practically hands you a Mega Lucario in X and Y's Tower of Mastery. It's one of the strongest Pokémon for an in game run, having phenomenal offensive stats of 110 / 115 / 90, which rises to 145 / 140 / 112 in its Mega form. Lucario also has a creative anime portrayal with the ability to sense auras extending across time and space. 

Lucarionite is important so that Lucario can Mega Evolve, in which it has the ability Adaptability, making STAB moves hit for 2x instead of 1.5x. Swords Dance, when combined with mechanics like Aurora Veil or Justified + Flygon's Brutal Swing, enables Lucario to sweep entire teams. Close Combat is the strongest Fighting type move to leverage Adaptability, and Lucario's all-out offensive stat distribution doesn't mind the defensive drops. Meteor Mash is the strongest Steel type move it learns besides the unreliable Iron Tail, and has a chance to further boost its Attack stat. Bullet Punch is an important priority move to pick off weak but faster foes.

If you've made it this far, thanks for being there while I nerd out for my favorites. Of course, these aren't the only Pokémon I have taken a liking to: honorable mentions include Cyndaquil, Lanturn, Shaymin, Togekiss, Helioptile, Leafeon, Ampharos, and Alolan Vulpix. I've had a great time writing this blog post and riding the waves of nostalgia. After all, identifying and celebrating favorite Pokémon is valuable to the spirit of Pokémon games, even as game mechanics tempt us towards legendaries with 600+ base stat totals. To quote one of the strongest trainers from the Kanto Region, a member of the Indigo Elite Four:
