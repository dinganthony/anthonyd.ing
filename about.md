A bit about me: I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, a short distance away from Apple's Infinite Loop campus. I attended [Saratoga High School](https://www.saratogahigh.org/) in Saratoga, CA, where I was involved in various math and science competitions. After graduating high school, I moved up the 880 to the [University of California, Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu) to study EECS, where I could continue enjoying the intricacies and beauty of math while diving deep into the world of computer and software technology.

My current academic interests lie in software systems, data science, and machine learning. On campus, I'm a participant in the [Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program](https://urap.berkeley.edu/), conducting research at [Berkeley Lab](https://lbl.gov) under Professor Haichen Wang. My research investigates using graph neural networks to classify particle physics phenomena and events from data collected by CERN's Large Hadron Collider. 

Berkeley has an incredible CS teaching community, which I'm fortunate to contribute to. In the past, I've taught on course staff for [CS 61B: Data Structures](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/sp20/) and been a Lab Assistant for [CS 61A: Computer Programs](https://cs61a.org/). In addition, I mentor for [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu), teaching weekly small group sections and creating LaTeX worksheets.

When I'm not shuttling between various coffee shops in Berkeley, I'm always looking to level up my software skills with projects like [Imprint](https://imprint.to), a social blogging platform focused on content ownership and accessibility. The Imprint team was part of the Summer 2020 cohort of the [Mozilla Builders](https://builders.mozilla.community/) MVP Lab incubator, receiving mentorship and $16k in grant funding. I've also led a committee for ongoing development of a new website for my honor society, [Eta Kappa Nu Mu Chapter](https://hkn.mu). Finally, I've previously interned at the North American R&D branch of [UBTECH Robotics](https://www.ubtrobot.com/?ls=en), specializing in software engineering and computer vision, and am currently interning at [Amazon](https://amazon.com).

In my free time, I riff and compose on my piano, one-trick Shen in *League of Legends*, and play blitz and bullet chess (read: blunder my pieces). When the sun is out, I enjoy running, playing pickup basketball, and exploring San Francisco. Sometimes, I wake up before dawn to tune in to games of my favorite soccer team, England's Liverpool Football Club. Recently, I also started a blog, [Anthology]({{site.baseurl}}/blog).
