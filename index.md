Welcome to my website! I'm a third-year undergraduate studying [EECS @ UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), passionate about solving problems to enrich people's lives.

Recently, my friends and I built [Imprint](https://imprint.to), a new social blogging platform focused on content ownership and discovery.

At Berkeley, I'm involved in [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu), a student organization dedicated to enabling student success in CS. Here's a [list](teaching) of my teaching materials and resources.

On the side, I write for my [blog](blog), one-trick Shen in League, and sacrifice sleep to watch Liverpool.

Feel free to email me at anthonyding \[at\] berkeley \[dot\] edu or check out my [resume](resume)!
