Welcome to my website! I'm a third-year undergraduate studying [EECS @ UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu) and an incoming SDE intern @ [Amazon](https://amazon.com).

At Berkeley, I conduct research @ [Lawrence Berkeley National Lab](https://lbl.gov) under Professor Haichen Wang. We're working on training graph neural networks on particle data from the Large Hadron Collider.

I'm also a senior mentor for [Computer Science Mentors](https://csmentors.berkeley.edu), a student organization dedicated to enabling student success in CS. Here's a [repository](https://github.com/dinganthony/teaching) of my teaching materials and resources.

On the side, I write for my [blog](blog), one-trick Shen in League, and sacrifice sleep to watch Liverpool. Previously, my friends and I built [Imprint](https://imprint.to), a new social blogging platform.

Feel free to email me at anthonyding \[at\] berkeley \[dot\] edu or check out my [resume](resume)!
