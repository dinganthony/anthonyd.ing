My name is Anthony Ding, and I'm a fourth-year undergrad majoring in [EECS @ UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu). I conduct research @ [Berkeley Lab](https://lbl.gov) under Professor Haichen Wang, developing [graph neural networks](https://github.com/xju/root_gnn) tailored for particle physics. Previously, I've interned @ [Amazon](https://amazon.com) and [UBTECH Robotics](https://ubtrobot.com/).

On the side, I mentor @ [Computer Science Mentors](https://csm.berkeley.edu) (a student organization providing small group tutoring sessions for Berkeley CS undergrads), build [Imprint](https://imprint.to) (a social blogging platform focused on content ownership), and run my two blogs ([Anthology](https://anthony.imprint.to) and [Tactical Press](blog)). In my free time, I like to support Liverpool FC, read, and [play chess](https://chess.com/member/ynotding).
