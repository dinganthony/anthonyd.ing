Welcome to my new (much simpler) website! This is still a WIP - pardon the internet dust.

I'm a third-year undergraduate studying [EECS @ UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu), passionate about creating technology to enrich people's lives. For instance, my friends and I built [Imprint](https://imprint.to), a new social blogging platform focused on content ownership and discovery. And I recently concluded an awesome summer internship at [UBTECH Robotics](https://ubtrobot.com) R&D, developing software to help robots see.

On the side, I'm an avid coffee drinker, soccer (Liverpool) and esports (League of Legends) fan, and hobby writer. I mainly write on my blog, [Anthology](blog).
