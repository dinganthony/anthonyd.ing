My name is Anthony Ding, and I'm a fourth-year undergrad majoring in [EECS @ UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu). Previously, I interned @ [Amazon](https://amazon.com) and [UBTECH Robotics](https://ubtrobot.com/), and conducted research @ [Berkeley Lab](https://lbl.gov) under Professor Haichen Wang, developing [graph neural networks](https://github.com/xju/root_gnn) tailored for particle physics. 

On the side, I run my two blogs ([Anthology](https://anthony.imprint.to) and [Tactical Press](tactical-press)). Previously, I mentored @ [Computer Science Mentors](https://csm.berkeley.edu) (a student organization providing small group tutoring sessions for Berkeley CS undergrads), and built [Imprint](https://imprint.to) (a social blogging platform focused on content ownership). In my free time, I am an avid supporter of Liverpool FC, reader, and [Teamfight Tactics](https://lolchess.gg/profile/na/dingtaifung) player.
