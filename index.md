<span id="greeting"></span>, and nice to meet you! I'm currently an SDE intern @ [Amazon](https://amazon.com) and a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in [EECS @ UC Berkeley](https://eecs.berkeley.edu). 

I conduct research @ [Berkeley Lab](https://lbl.gov) under Professor Haichen Wang. I work on a [suite](https://github.com/xju2/root_gnn) of graph neural networks tailored for particle physics.

I'm also a senior mentor @ [Computer Science Mentors](https://csm.berkeley.edu). For my students, here's a [repository](https://github.com/dinganthony/teaching) of teaching materials I've written. 

On the side, I've worked on [Imprint](https://imprint.to), a social blogging platform focused on content ownership and accessibility. Last summer, we incubated @ [Mozilla Builders](https://builders.mozilla.community/) MVP Lab.

I've created six [themes](themes) for my website, so feel free to pick your favorite!
